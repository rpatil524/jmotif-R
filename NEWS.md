# jmotif 1.3.1

* Memory and performance (Phases 1–4):
  - Fix memory leaks in RePair grammar (`rule_record` by-value), RRA, and
    `cosine_sim` (Valgrind-clean on long runs).
  - HOT-SAX: precompute z-normed sliding windows (~1.4× on ecg0606, ~17× on
    longer series); identical discord positions and distances.
  - SAX sliding window: `_paa2` in-place fractional PAA, `_znorm_slice`,
    unified `_sax_via_window` path (~2.3× on bag construction).
  - RRA: fused normalized distance, precomputed `w_size` z-norm windows
    (~1.3× on ecg0606); identical results and distance-call counts.
* Safety: `idx_to_letter()` validates index range [1, 26].
* Internal: use `_is_equal_mindist(std::string)` in SAX numerosity reduction;
  remove unused HOT-SAX state; clarify `cosine_dist()` roxygen.

## Unreleased

Post-**1.3.1** (CRAN) documentation, CI, and input guards. No behavioral changes to
the SAX / discord / VSM / grammar core beyond degenerate-input handling.

* **Tests:** tier-B RRA conformance pins on ecg0606 (w100/w120/w150 region and distance).
* **Safety:** guard degenerate inputs (empty series, invalid parameters); fix
  `is_equal_mindist` example.
* **CI / style:** update `.lintr` to lintr 3.x API scoped to package `R/`; fix all
  lintr style warnings in `R/jmotif.R`.
* **Docs:** README badge URLs updated; GPL v2 license badge added.
* **Housekeeping:** ignore and block Cursor/Claude/agent artifacts via `.gitignore` and
  optional git hooks.

# Version 1.3.0
* Cross-implementation alignment with the saxpy (Python) reference and the
  Matrix Profile / MASS convention:
  - znorm now uses POPULATION standard deviation (divide by n) instead of
    sample std (n-1). Each normalized window then has empirical variance
    exactly 1, the assumption behind SAX's equiprobable Gaussian breakpoints.
  - SAX symbol assignment maps a value exactly on a breakpoint to the symbol
    ABOVE the cut (cuts[j] <= ts[i]), matching the jmotif Java original and
    saxpy. Previously a strict `<` mapped on-cut values to the symbol below.
  - PAA: fixed a floating-point boundary bug in the fractional PAA (_paa2,
    the public paa() / sax_by_chunking path). The final segment break
    paa_num * (len/paa_num) can round above len in IEEE-754 (e.g. 7*(29/7) =
    29.000000000000004), which dropped the last sample from the final segment
    and corrupted its mean on ~5-6% of non-divisible (n, paa_num) shapes. The
    final break is now snapped to len, matching the saxpy / Java fractional PAA.
  NOTE: all three are behavioral changes -- SAX words for windows whose
  normalized PAA values fall near a breakpoint may differ from 1.2.x output.
* HOT-SAX and brute-force discord discovery now measure the nearest-neighbour
  distance on Z-NORMED windows (the SAX premise of shape similarity):
  - find_discords_hotsax: the three internal _znorm() calls had been left
    commented out, so distances were computed on RAW subsequences -- it reported
    raw-amplitude outliers (e.g. ecg0606 pos 411 / 1.50) instead of true
    z-normed shape discords (pos 430 / 5.28). The windows are now z-normed and
    compared with an early-abandoning Euclidean distance.
  - find_discords_brute_force now z-normalizes too and gained an `n_threshold`
    parameter (default 0.01); previously it had no threshold and ran on raw
    subsequences. It is again a valid z-normed reference for HOT-SAX.
  - Both now use a deterministic lowest-index tie-break and a +/-(w-1) exclusion
    zone, so results are reproducible and match saxpy / Java exactly
    (ecg0606 top discords: 430/5.279, 318/4.176, 2080/2.393).
  NOTE: behavioral change -- discord positions/distances differ from 1.2.x,
  which reported raw-distance discords.
